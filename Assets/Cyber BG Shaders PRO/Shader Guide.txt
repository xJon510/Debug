Custom Shader Properties â€“ Unity Shader Graph

Overview:

Transparency (BG, P1, P2): Real-time see-through control for backgrounds.
Ideal for overlays, transition, and scene blending.

This shader supports three customizable black-and-white texture inputs:
- Background Texture (BG Texture)
- Pattern 1 (P1 Texture)
- Pattern 2 (P2 Texture)
- All textures must be in a 1:1 aspect ratio.

BG Texture
- A black-and-white texture used as the base layer.
- Must be square (1:1 aspect ratio) to avoid distortion.
- BG1 Color1 and BG1 Color2:
  - Color1 fills the white areas of the texture.
  - Color2 fills the black areas of the texture.
  - This lets you recolor the grayscale texture dynamically.
- Tiling and Offset Animation:
  - Supports scrolling animation using Animation_X and Animation_Y.
  - Set both to 0 for no animation.
  - Used for effects like moving backgrounds or scanning lines.

Twirl Strength
- Applies a twirl distortion effect to BG, P1, and P2.
- Twirl can be toggled on or off individually for Pattern 1 and Pattern 2.
- Useful for creating warped or animated swirl effects.

Posterize
- Applies a posterization effect (reduces color levels) to BG, P1, and P2.
- Helps create stylized visuals like comic or retro looks.

Noise Effects
- Adds displacement and distortion using a noise texture.
- Affects BG, P1, and P2 using:
  - Noise Scale
  - Noise Strength
  - Noise Tile
  - Noise Speed
- To apply noise distortion on Pattern 1 and Pattern 2, turn on "Twirl on P1" and "Twirl on P2".
- Great for glitchy, fluid, or wavy distortion effects.

Hue Adjustment
- Can be enabled or disabled.
- Applies hue shift to the overall shader output.
- Useful for color variation or animated color changes.

Pattern 1 (P1) and Pattern 2 (P2)
- Optional overlay textures, black-and-white only.
- Each supports:
  - Opacity adjustment
  - Scale control
  - Animation via offset
- Ideal for adding extra details like grids, symbols, or sci-fi overlays.

General Notes:
- All three textures (BG, P1, P2) must be black-and-white and 1:1 ratio.
- Set Animation_X and Animation_Y to 0 for no movement.
- Noise and Twirl effects on P1 and P2 require toggling them on manually.
